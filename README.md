# chatgpt-test

This repository was initialized by GitHub Copilot on behalf of the repository owner.

## Purpose
A small test repository for trying out GitHub features and automation.

## Usage

The repository contains a small Python utility that renders chord diagrams as PNG files.

```bash
pip install pillow
python generate_chord_diagram.py "Em7" --output Em7.png
```

If no `--output` path is provided, the script saves the diagram to `<CHORD>.png` in the current directory.
